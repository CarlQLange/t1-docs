# Tessel

You can import Tessel into your project by using `var tessel = require('tessel')`.

array<Port> tessel.port = []
A list of ports available on Tessel.

```js
var tessel = require('tessel'); // import tessel
var gpio = tessel.port['GPIO']; // select the GPIO port
gpio.digital[1].writeSync(1);  // turn digital pin #1 high
```

array<Pin> tessel.led = []
An array of Pins available on the Tessel board.


# Pins

GPIO access for digital and analog signal lines. Each port exposes its available GPIO lines through the `.digital`, `.analog`, and `.pwm` arrays.


array<number> port.digital = []
An array of which pins are digital inputs/outputs.

array<number> port.analog = []
An array of which pins are analog inputs/outputs.

array<number> port.pwm = []
An array of which pins are PWM outputs (may overlap analog array).


new port.Pin ( `pin`, `dir` or `initialOutput` )
Create and return `pin` object. If `dir` is "input" or "output", the direction is set to that value immediately. Otherwise, the pin is written to with the value of `initialOutput`. 

string pin.type
"digital" or "analog".

boolean pin.isPWM
Whether the `pin.type` is set to `"analog"` and output type is PWM (thus not true analog).

boolean pin.readable
Whether the pin is readable.

boolean pin.writeable
Whether the pin is writeable.

number pin.resolution
Digital pins: 1. Analog pins: ADC resolution of output pins (e.g. 1024 for Tessel).

string pin.direction
"output" or "input".

pin.setInput( [callback(err)] )
Set `pin` to be an input. Sets `err` if the pin cannot be used as an input. 

pin.setOutput ( [`initial`], [callback(err)] ) 
Set `pin` to be an output. Sets `err` if the pin cannot be used as an output.  


pin.write ( `value`, [`callback(err)`] ) 
Write the `value` to an output pin. Digital pins: output is set HIGH if `value` is truthy, otherwise LOW. Analog pins: `value` is a float that sets the analog output value. Sets `err` if the pin cannot be used as a digital output or is not configured as an output.

pin.writeSync ( `value` )
Synchronous version of `pin.write`. Throws on error.

pin.read ( `callback(err, value)` ) 
Read a digital `value` from a digital input pin. `1` is returned if the value is HIGH, otherwise `0` if LOW. Sets `err` if the pin cannot be used as a digital input or is not configured as an input. An error is given to the callback if the pin cannot be used as a digital input or is not configured as an input.

pin.readSync () -> number
Synchronous version of `pin.read`. Throws on error.


pin.watch ( [type,] callback(err, time) )  
Sets a listener for a signal edge on `pin`. `type` can be one of "rise", "fall", "both", or omitted (analogous to "both"). Watched events registers events on the `pin` object, with the same `type` as the event.

pin.unwatch ( [type,] listener )
Removes the listener for a signal.


# SPI

A SPI channel.

new port.SPI ( [`idx`] )  
Creates a SPI channel.


spi.use (`onconnected(err)`)  
Initializes the SPI channel.


spi.setClockSpeed ( mhz, [callback(err)] ) 
Set the SPI output speed to the number `mhz`.

spi.setCPOL ( `cpol`, [`callback(err)`] ) 
Set CPOL (SPI polarity). 

spi.setCPHA ( `cpha`, [`callback(err)`] ) 
Set CPHA (SPI bit significance).


spi.transfer ( txbuf, [rxbuf,] callback(err, rxbuf) )
Transfers a Buffer `txbuf` to the client and receives a response in `rxbuf`. If `rxbuf` is passed in, it is used as the receive buffer. Otherwise, a new buffer is allocated.

spi.transferSync ( txbuf ) -> Buffer
Synchronous version of `spi.transfer`. Throws on error.

spi.receive ( len, [rxbuf,] callback(err, rxbuf) ) 
Reads `len` bytes from a client. If `rxbuf` is passed in, it is used as the receive buffer. Otherwise, a new buffer is allocated.

spi.receiveSync ( len ) -> Buffer
Synchronous version of `spi.receive`. Throws on error.

spi.send ( txbuf, callback(err) ) 
Sends a Buffer `txbuf` to the client.

spi.sendSync ( txbuf )
Synchronous version of `spi.send`. Throws on error.


# I2C

An I2C channel.

new port.I2C ( address, [idx] )  
Creates an I2C channel for a device of a specific `address`. Multiple I2C channels can be used in parallel.


i2c.use ( `onconnected(err)` )  
Initializes the I2C channel.


i2c.transfer ( txbuf, [rxbuf,] callback(err, rxbuf) )
Transfers a Buffer `txbuf` to the client and receives a response in `rxbuf`. If `rxbuf` is passed in, it is used as the receive buffer. Otherwise, a new buffer is allocated.

i2c.transferSync ( txbuf ) -> Buffer
Synchronous version of `i2c.transfer`. Throws on error.

i2c.receive ( len, [rxbuf,] callback(err, rxbuf) ) 
Reads `len` bytes from a client. If `rxbuf` is passed in, it is used as the receive buffer. Otherwise, a new buffer is allocated.

i2c.receiveSync ( len ) -> Buffer

i2c.send ( txbuf, callback(err) ) 
Sends a Buffer `txbuf` to the client.
