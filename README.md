This is Tessel. Think of it as a tiny server, or a tiny robot you can control from the internet.

Tessel is programmed in JavaScript, and comes with Wifi built in. Capabilities such as sensing, and actuation can be added to Tessel with plug-and-play modules, or you can do your own wiring through the GPIO bank.

Tessel was designed for web developers to work in the world of hardware for the first time. However, whether you come from a web development background or have spent the last 40 years working in controls systems, we hope that you find Tessel easy and enjoyable to use.
